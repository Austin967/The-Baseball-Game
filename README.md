# Baseball-Game

Game Design 1 Group Project

This was a group project about a baseball that needs to find its way back home.
In this game, you play as baseball and use physics and the mouse to launch yourself around the map to find your way back home.

The Design

This was a group project that I helped with coding and sound. I helped with coding the physics and the teleportation of the ball when it reached certain points.
